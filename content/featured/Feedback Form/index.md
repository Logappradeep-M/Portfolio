I have created a comprehensive feedback system for Amirtha Hotel Kangayam using Google Forms integrated with Google Sheets. This system includes detailed steps for setting up the form, customizing its theme, and ensuring its functionality. I have also provided instructions for sharing the form, enabling notifications, and using JavaScript to enhance the form. Additionally, I emphasized the importance of regular data backups, version control, and security measures. Proper credit is given to me for the original creation.
